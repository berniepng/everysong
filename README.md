**Why these choices:**

- `node:sqlite` ships with Node 22 — zero native module compilation headaches on the server. No `better-sqlite3` build failures, no Python/gyp dependencies.
- Server-side rendering via EJS means the app works without JavaScript enabled and has fast first-paint with no hydration overhead.
- SQLite is the right tool here — the dataset is read-heavy, single-server, and fits comfortably in memory. No Postgres/MySQL overhead for what is essentially a static catalogue.
- No TypeScript, no bundler, no framework — deliberately minimal. The complexity ceiling is low; the maintainability ceiling is high.

## Database schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE artists (
  id           INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  slug         TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,   -- URL identifier e.g. "bts", "petshopboys"
  name         TEXT NOT NULL,
  description  TEXT,
  country      TEXT,
  genre        TEXT,
  formed_year  INTEGER,
  image_url    TEXT,
  created_at   DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE songs (

  song_name     TEXT NOT NULL,
  album         TEXT,
  sung_by       TEXT,

);
```

## Adding a new artist

### Step 1 — Prepare your CSV

Create a file in `scripts/` named `yourartist_discography.csv` with these columns:

```
song_name,album,sung_by,year_released,highlights
```

**Rules:**

- Wrap all values in double quotes
- Escape internal double quotes by doubling them: `"He said ""hello"""`
- `sung_by` — use the group name for group tracks, member name(s) for solos/units
- `year_released` — four-digit year only
- `highlights` — one or two sentences maximum; keep it factual

**Example rows:**

```csv
"Dancing Queen","Arrival","ABBA",1976,"Written as a tribute to Queen Elizabeth II; became their signature song and only US #1"
"Waterloo","Waterloo","ABBA",1974,"Eurovision Song Contest winner 1974; launched them internationally"
"The Winner Takes It All","Super Trouper","ABBA",1980,"Written by Bjorn about his divorce from Agnetha; considered their finest ballad"
```

### Step 2 — Create a seed script

Copy `scripts/seed-bts.js` to `scripts/seed-yourartist.js` and update:

```javascript
// Change the artist details
db.prepare(`INSERT OR IGNORE INTO artists ...`).run(
  "abba", // slug — used in the URL: /everysong/abba
  "ABBA", // display name
  "Swedish pop group...", // description shown on the artist page
  "Sweden", // country — used for flag emoji
  "Pop, Disco, Dance-pop", // genre tags
  1972, // formed year
);

// Change the CSV filename
const csvPath = path.join(__dirname, "abba_discography.csv");

// Change the iTunes search artist name
const art = await fetchArt("ABBA", album);
```

### Step 3 — Add an npm script (optional)

In `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "seed:abba": "node --experimental-sqlite scripts/seed-abba.js"
}
```

### Step 4 — Run on your server

```bash
node --experimental-sqlite scripts/seed-yourartist.js
pm2 restart everysong
```

The artist will appear automatically on the landing page at `/everysong/yourslug`.

## URL structure

```
/everysong/                          Landing page — all artists
/everysong/:slug                     Artist gallery (e.g. /everysong/bts)
/everysong/:slug?search=dynamite     Search
/everysong/:slug?year=2020           Filter by year
/everysong/:slug?album=Wings         Filter by album
/everysong/:slug?sung_by=Jimin       Filter by performer
/everysong/:slug?sort=year_desc      Sort (year_asc, year_desc, name_asc, name_desc, album_asc)
/everysong/:slug?page=2              Pagination
/everysong/api/art                   Internal iTunes art fetch endpoint
```

All filter parameters stack — e.g. `?year=2020&sung_by=Jimin&sort=name_asc` works.

## Deploying to your own server

See [DEPLOY.md](./DEPLOY.md) for the full step-by-step guide. The short version:

**Requirements:**

- Node.js 22+ (for built-in `node:sqlite`)
- nginx (for reverse proxy)
- PM2 (for process management)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/everysong.git
cd everysong

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install --ignore-scripts

# 3. Seed the database
npm run seed:all

# 4. Start with PM2
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
pm2 save && pm2 startup

# 5. Add nginx location block (see nginx-snippet.conf)
sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

**Note:** The app runs on port `3010` by default. Set `PORT` environment variable to change it. The `--ignore-scripts` flag avoids native module compilation — this project uses only pure-JS dependencies plus Node's built-in sqlite.

---

## Album art

Album art is sourced from the **iTunes Search API** at runtime — no images are stored locally. On server startup, a background job fetches art URLs for any albums not yet cached in the database and stores the CDN URL. Subsequent page loads serve the cached URL directly.

If the iTunes API has no art for an album, a styled placeholder is shown with the album name.

---

## CI

GitHub Actions runs on every push to `main` and every pull request:

1. **Syntax check** — validates all JS files with `node --check`
2. **CSV validation** — parses both discography CSVs and asserts minimum row counts
3. **DB integrity** — seeds BTS data into an in-memory test DB and runs key queries

See `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

---

## What's not included (deliberately)

- **No user accounts** — read-only public catalogue, no auth needed
- **No external database** — SQLite is appropriate for this use case
- **No React/Vue/bundler** — SSR EJS keeps the stack simple and fast
- **No image storage** — iTunes CDN handles art delivery
- **No web scraping** — all discography data was compiled manually from Wikipedia, official fan wikis, and Discogs, then stored in version-controlled CSVs

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Admin UI for adding/editing songs without re-running seed scripts
- [ ] Artist-level image upload
- [ ] "Did you know?" random song highlight on landing page
- [ ] Export filtered results as CSV
- [ ] Multiple language support for song names (Korean/Japanese originals alongside English translations)
- [ ] Pet Shop Boys Further Listening bonus disc gap-fill
